# Imagenet Fine-Tuning, Transfer-Learning and both together

Deep learning TD during my advanced machine learning class at Ecole Polytechnique. 

We were tasked to try both transfer learning and Fine tuning to construct an image classifier (Dogs vs. Cats) using Imagenet data.
We then had to benchmark the methods and showcase the parameters, hyperparameters and layers we added to obtain our results.
